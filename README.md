# Console Wheel Decide



Console Wheel Decide
Welcome to the Console version of the Wheel Decide!

This simple Kotlin program allows you to make a random selection from a list of options provided by the user. It mimics the fun and randomness of spinning a wheel to make a decision.

**How to Use**
1. Run the program in a Kotlin environment.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions:
- Enter the single-word names you would like to select from, separated by commas without spaces.
- Press Enter to proceed.
3. The program will shuffle the options and simulate the mixing process.
4. After a brief delay, the program will randomly pick and display one of the options.
